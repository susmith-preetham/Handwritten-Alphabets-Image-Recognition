# Handwritten-Alphabets-Image-Recognition
The data consists of handwritten images of alphabets. Using PIL images are resized, converted to greyscale and flattened. Machine Learning models are build using KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost. Evaluated models using metrics like Accuracy and confusion matrix to identify the most effective solution.
